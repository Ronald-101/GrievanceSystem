Milestone 1: Project Setup and Design

Setup Development Environment:

Set up a Python environment with necessary libraries (Flask, scikit-learn, joblib).
Create a virtual environment.
Design Database Schema:

Identify the key information to be stored (e.g., grievance text, urgency level).
Design a simple database schema.
Initialize Flask App:

Set up a basic Flask application structure.
Create routes for home page and grievance submission.
Milestone 2: Frontend Development with HTML and Bootstrap

Create HTML Templates:

Develop HTML templates for the home page and grievance submission form.
Integrate Bootstrap for styling.
Implement Form Submission:

Use JavaScript to handle form submission using the Fetch API.
Update the frontend dynamically based on the response.
Milestone 3: Train NLP Model in Jupyter Notebook

Load and Preprocess Dataset:

Load the provided dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
Perform any necessary preprocessing (e.g., lowercasing, tokenization).
Vectorize Text Data:

Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train NLP Model:

Choose a model (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes).
Train the model using the training data.
Evaluate Model:

Make predictions on the test set.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
Milestone 4: Backend Development with Flask

Integrate Model with Flask:

Integrate the trained NLP model into the Flask backend.
Create an endpoint to receive grievance submissions and classify them.
Database Integration:

Set up a database using Flask-SQLAlchemy or a similar library.
Implement functionality to store grievance data in the database.
User Authentication (Optional):

Implement a basic user authentication system if needed.
Milestone 5: Administrator Panel and Urgent Grievance Handling

Administrator Dashboard:

Create an administrator dashboard to view and manage grievances.
Implement functionality to prioritize and act on urgent grievances.
Refine and Optimize Model:

Analyze model performance and make adjustments as needed.
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
Milestone 6: Testing and Debugging

Unit Testing:

Perform unit testing for each component (frontend, backend, model).
Ensure that grievance classification and submission work as expected.
System Testing:

Conduct system-level testing to ensure all components integrate seamlessly.
Test edge cases and handle potential errors.
Milestone 7: Deployment and Maintenance

Deploy the System:

Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) and deploy the Flask application.
Set up the database in a production environment.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement logging and monitoring to track system behavior.
Address any issues that arise in the production environment.
Regular Maintenance:

Schedule regular maintenance to update the system, handle user feedback, and improve performance.
This breakdown provides a structured plan for developing the grievance system, from initial setup to deployment and maintenance. Adjustments can be made based on your specific requirements and preferences.
